# Analyzing Crime in Chicago Through Machine Learning

It is critical to recognise crime patterns in order to respond more effectively to criminal activities.
The Chicago Data Portal is a massive archive of data that can provide insight into the patterns of
crime. This pattern is examined using derived datasets from the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s CLEAR
(Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. This collection contains various blocks of
the city of Chicago. Our data set consists of 107 feature vector each containing 23 features. We have
treated the problem as an unsupervised machine leaning technique.

There may be a slew of factors that influence the crime rate and the type of crime that are
not immediately evident, but recognising them is the challenge. The main goal of this study is to
predict which type of crime is most likely to occur at specific times and locations in Chicago. This
predictive capability is designed to aid in crime prevention by providing insights that will allow them to
track activities, anticipate the likelihood of events, effectively deploy resources, and optimise decision
making.
